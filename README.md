# CLOCK-BMAL1-DNA-Binding

All simulations of the DNA binding model found in Figures 6, 7 and 8, both deterministic (ODE) and stochastic were performed in these 3 jupyter notebooks. Relevant data used to fit and simulate the data are defined in the data folder and within the notebooks themselves.

The data folder contains:
- Disassocation (Kd) values
- FCS timelapse data of diffusion, concentration and Kd
- DNA binding off rate from analysed FRAP data
- FCS calibrated fluorescence timelapse data for PER2 from Smyllie et al 2016 Curr. Biol (DOI: 10.1016/j.cub.2016.05.018)
